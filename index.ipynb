When the computer runs the program, it will create objects and manipulate them, according to our instructions.  For example, we could tell it to create some objects representing numbers, add them together, then show us (`print`) the result.  If you click on the block of code below to select it, then click on the \"run\" button in the toolbar above (or press ctrl+enter), you should see the output appear underneath."
